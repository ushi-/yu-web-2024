From wildfires to the pandemic, the past year has been marked by a number of crises — and we’re nowhere near the end of them. Few could have imagined 2020 would be the year that goverments would financially support workers or restrict private-car usage on city roads to promote greener, more active modes of transport. Crises redefine our ways of being and open up prospects of transition. The Overton window — the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time — is wide open, allowing us to glimpse the possibilities of other worlds.

And yet, during the pandemic, we have seen too many mainstream design practices remaining trapped in teh current paradigm, proposing a barrage of speculative product or app ideas — essentially making marketing stunts out of a crisis that has been horrific for many people.

There is a limit to the extend to which individual products can provide solutions to wider systemic issues. Yet design as a profession is of pivotal importance, and the urgency of the present should make this our watershed moment. As crises act on the world, our values are changing. We can’t go back to normal. Neither should design.

As a society, we are in a position where we can initiate an intentional transition into a more just, ethical and sustainable future, and design has new roles to play within it. Mere speculation or provocation is not enough. What we need are tangible pathways towards the other worlds that crises allow us to imagine. Instead. of proposing a speculative product that supposedly solves a problem in a vastly simplified and idealised world, designers should strive to create outputs that describe and respond to what the world could become.

By valuing pathways over products, and processes over results, successful projects would allow people to interrogate those possible futures by interacting with real and actionable objects and ideas.

As an example, speculative forest-governance proposals developed by Amsterdam-based Studio Formafantasma as part of its Cambio project explore laws that would manage the timber industry and change our relationship with the world's forests - source of so much building and design material - in response to the climate crisis. Here, the studio has shifted the focus from the immediate end result of a designed object to the process of designing a different relationship with the world around us. Work like this shows us that, through the detailed mapping of pathways leading from now into different futures, designers can acknowledge and respond to complexity while working towards initiating systemic change.

Terry Irwin - one of the founders of the Transition Design Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and an expert in designing for change within complex systems - emphasises the importance of understanding the ecologies of interventions. In her view, any design intervention must look beyond conventional disciplinary boundaries, recognise the interconnectivity between all those it affects, and make". space for people to exist, have conversations and act.

This is especially crucial during times of great turmoil.

The interrogation of material quality and production processes, the deep engagement with the audience, and the sensitivity towards space for others should be familiar to anyone in creative practice. However, it is only when these qualities are intentionally directed towards a systemic change that designing what comes next' can go beyond a stunt, and create space for us to discuss how and when we can get there. As designers, our response to crises must show what the world could be - both mapping and clearing the pathways towards its becoming.
