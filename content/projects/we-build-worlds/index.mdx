Takram designed a creative experience for Sony’s unique Life Space UX products such as 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector, Portable Ultra Short Throw Projector, and Glass Sound Speaker. The experience is set within the residence of J.H. Vincent, a fictional sci-fi author, as he is about to begin writing his latest book… "We Build Worlds". In his apartment, we explored how we can transform our domestic space through the creative use of audio and visual augmentation.

To best convey the concept of LSUX ― unlocking the potential hidden in everyday space, we used the projectors and speakers as a means to bring narratives into life. The fictional character J.H. Vincent and his apartment serve as a platform for these narratives. Embedded in his apartment, LSUX products augment his sci-fi imagination and navigate visitors into this expanded domestic space where the boundary between real and fiction is blurred.

Each exhibit highlights LSUX products' unique potential to the full extent. Subtle and intricate animations exploit the high-definition nature of the 4K Projector, while Portable Projector is placed everywhere in the residence to show off its portability and ultra-short throw, with one of them even revolving.
