  At Takram, we had the chance to present our approaches to Data Humanisation at
  the 2020 Design Indaba. One of them was RISAR – an augmented reality
  visualisation app prototype that personalises the effects of climate change to
  question our thoughts and actions concerning the climate crisis. Details of
  the presentation are available on [Takram
  Stories](https://medium.com/takram-stories/data-humanisation-in-action-2555172f96b4).

#### Data Humanisation in Action

<Monolingual>

RISAR asks you a set of questions about your day-to-day activities, and you
answer them with a simple, almost Tinder-like interaction between different
options (e.g. food choice, travel option etc.) The virtual water level rises
or falls, depending on your answer. We believe RISAR has the potential to
become a powerful experience that shows how individual lifestyle choices can
cause a massive, collective impact on the world.

To demonstrate how immersive data experience (e.g. AR, VR, etc.) can facilitate a better understanding of issues like climate change, we tested out RISAR in front of a live audience. We gave everyone a ping-pong bat, coloured red on one side and yellow on the other, to use in response to the questions displayed on the presentation screen. Fortunately for the Indaba audience, their answers resulted in them escaping from a mass AR drowning!
