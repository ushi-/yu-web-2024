  Since the formation of the nation-state, state surveillance of some form has
  been part of our lives. Today most countries across the world have specialised
  and well-funded agencies tasked with watching their citizens, from the GCHQ in
  the UK to NATGRID in India and the now famous NSA in the United States.

  However, it is the tools and techniques at the disposal of these agencies that
  have undergone the most radical change, taking full advantage of the
  increasingly networked nature of our lives. The NSA, GCHQ and other government
  security services secretly collect and scan our personal information and
  correspondence for trigger words; from the overtly malevolent: 'anthrax',
  'assassination' and 'bomb' to the seemingly benign: 'pork', 'dock' and
  'storm'. According to a top-secret heat map published by [The
  Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining)
  and produced by the NSA's [Boundless
  Informant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundless_Informant) program, almost
  three billion data elements from inside the United States were captured by the
  NSA over 30 days ending in March 2013.

  In response, Open Informant attempts to confront the unsettling realities of
  surveillance in a networked age. It is a phone app and e-ink badge. The app
  searches your communications for these NSA trigger words and then sends text
  fragments containing these words to the badge for public display. Using the
  body as an instrument for protest, the badge becomes a means of rendering our
  own voice visible in an otherwise faceless technological panopticon. By openly
  displaying what is currently taken by forceful stealth, we question the
  intrusive forms of mass surveillance adopted by democratic nations on its own
  citizenry, and in the process, shift the conversation around wearables from
  being about you and your body as a machine, to the culture of machine
  intelligence and algorithmic monitoring.
