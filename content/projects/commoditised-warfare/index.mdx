Commoditised Warfare proposes an alternative world where spectacular events are custom-designed to replace traditional warfare as a means of solving seemingly chronic conflicts. Whether it be a made-up sport, a bizarre ceremony, or an extravagant technology, each event is specially designed to reflect the cultural and geopolitical characteristics of the opposing sides. Examples are presented as a series of spectacles centred around toy-models such as mechanised ‘Deluxe’ models, graphic packages, TV adverts, model-nerd’s video and so on, encouraging the audience to imagine how these events might be operated and consumed.
