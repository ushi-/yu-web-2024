# New Year's Day

<Button>Test</Button>

I'm writing this on New Year's Day, 2019. I'm not a big fan of New Year's resolutions, but I do like to take some time to reflect on the past year and think about what I want to accomplish in the coming year. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here, but I do want to write down a few things that I want to focus on in 2019.
